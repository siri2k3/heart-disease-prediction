    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

    <p>In this article, we will be closely working with the heart disease prediction and for that, we will be looking
        into the heart disease dataset from that dataset we will derive various insights that help us know the weightage
        of each feature and how they are interrelated to each other but this time our sole aim is to detect the
        probability of person that will be affected by a savior heart problem or not.</p>

    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

    <p>Heart stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early diagnosis and prevention are crucial for
        reducing the burden of heart stroke. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for heart stroke
        prediction, but its effectiveness relies heavily on the availability of large amounts of labeled data.
        Traditional supervised learning methods often face challenges due to the limited availability of labeled data
        and the high cost of manual labeling. Semi-supervised machine learning offers a promising solution to this
        challenge by leveraging both clinical and non clinical data to improve prediction performance.</p>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>The introduction for a project on an "Optimized Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Approach for Heart Stroke
        Prediction" should provide an overview of the project's objectives, significance, and the approach you'll be
        taking to predict heart strokes. Below is a sample introduction to help you get started:</p>

    <p>Cardiovascular diseases, including heart strokes, remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally.
        Early detection and accurate prediction of heart stroke risk are crucial for preventive interventions and
        improved patient outcomes. In recent years, machine learning techniques have shown great promise in healthcare,
        providing valuable tools for predictive modeling.</p>

    <p>This project focuses on developing an optimized semi-supervised machine learning approach for heart stroke
        prediction, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to enhance the predictive accuracy of the model. The
        semi-supervised learning paradigm is particularly relevant in healthcare scenarios where obtaining labeled data
        can be expensive and time-consuming. By harnessing the information contained in unlabeled data, this approach
        aims to create a robust predictive model capable of identifying individuals at risk of experiencing a heart
        stroke.</p>

    <h2>The primary objectives of this project include:</h2>

    <img src="https://scificongress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HeartDiseaseRiskFactors.jpg" align="center">

    <p>Data Preprocessing:</p>

    <p>Thoroughly prepare and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, scaling features, and ensuring data
        quality. This step is critical to obtaining reliable and informative input for the machine learning model.</p>

    <p>Semi-Supervised Learning:</p>

    <p>Implement a semi-supervised machine learning framework that effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data.
        This approach involves training a base classifier on the labeled data and then iteratively refining the model by
        incorporating predictions on unlabeled data, improving its generalization and predictive capabilities.</p>

    <p>Model Evaluation:</p>

    <p> Assess the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics. The project aims to achieve
        a high level of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in identifying individuals at risk of heart strokes.</p>

    <p>Optimization Techniques:</p>

    <p>Explore and implement optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the semi-supervised
        learning approach. This may involve hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or other strategies to fine-tune
        the model.</p>

    <p>Interpretability:</p>

    <p>Strive for interpretability in the model's predictions, enabling healthcare professionals to understand and trust
        the outcomes. Explainability is crucial for translating model predictions into actionable insights in a clinical
        setting.</p>

    <p>Through this project, we aim to contribute to the advancement of predictive analytics in healthcare, specifically
        in the domain of heart stroke prediction. By leveraging the power of semi-supervised machine learning, we
        anticipate achieving a model that not only demonstrates high accuracy but is also capable of handling real-world
        challenges associated with limited labeled data in the healthcare domain.</p>

    <h2>EXISTING SYSTEM</h2>

    <p>Existing approaches for heart stroke prediction predominantly rely on supervised machine learning methods. These
        methods require large amounts of labeled data to train the prediction model. However, collecting and labeling
        large datasets can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. Moreover, the availability of labeled data
        is often limited for specific patient populations or medical conditions.</p>

    <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>

    <p>Cardiovascular diseases, including heart strokes, remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early and
        accurate prediction of individuals at risk of heart strokes is crucial for timely intervention and improved
        patient outcomes. Traditional supervised machine learning models often face limitations due to the scarcity of
        labeled data. To overcome this challenge, a semi-supervised approach that leverages both labeled and unlabeled
        data, coupled with optimization techniques, can enhance the accuracy and generalization of heart stroke
        prediction models.</p>

    <h2>SOLUTION </h2>

    <p>Develop an optimized semi-supervised machine learning model for heart stroke prediction that efficiently utilizes
        both labeled and unlabeled data to improve predictive performance.This research utilized Google Colab on a Ryzen
        7 computer with a 4800-H processorand 16 GB of RAM. The dataset consisted of 70,000 rows and 12 attributes, but
        after cleaningand preprocessing, it was reduced to approximately 59,000 rows and 11 attributes.
        Sinceallattributes were categorical, outliers were removed to improve the model efficiency. Thealgorithmsused in
        this study were random forest, decision tree, multilayer perception, andXGBoost classifier. This study used
        several measures of performance, namely, precision,recall, accuracy, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve. The
        dataset was split intotwo parts: 80% ofthe data used to train model and 20% used to test the model.</p>
